SetFuncBps - Darin Ellis 4/27/2018

OVERVIEW
SetFuncBps is a bash script that will automatically generate a gdb script that will
set breakpoints at the certain named functions for any number of given binaries. 

It uses the "readelf" program to obtain the symbols of the binary and "awk" to
select the functions with a variation of the strings "read" or "write" in their names. 
It then invokes the provided "WriteBps" program to generate the .gdb file. You can
then invoke this .gdb file when using gdb.

INSTALLATION
SetFuncBps runs on "bash". It requires the "readelf" and "awk" programs to be on
your computer. It also requires "WriteBps" to run. WriteBps can be compiled by invoking
the provided Makefile.

USAGE
Invoke the script with:
"./SetFuncBps.sh [filenames]"
Where [filenames] is the path(s) to the file(s) you wish to generate the .gdb file(s) 
for.
